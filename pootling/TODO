*do not crash when a not welformed xliff was read.

*Ctrl-S while in the edit widget does not save data.  You have to tab
out before string is updated i.e. you can lose data

*Lots of requests to save file when nothing was changed.  Some seem to
be related to if you have plurals ie the tabs exist

*Hacker
No tracebacks if there is an issue with the application.  A pain to
debug and a pain for anyone giving feedback.  We should be able to do
--errorlevel=traceback

*Plural forms
Doesn't seem to read header ie if you have nplurals=3 and your editor
is set to 2 you will only see 2.  Unworkable if you are reviewing a
file.

The interface is unworkable, it emulates KBable and poEdits
frustrating interfaces.  Ideally you should see all plurals for source
and target at once and be able to tab between all of them.  Currently
you have to use the mouse to click on each tab of both source and target
plural forms.

*Localisation
Still many bugs in the messages, the only way to fix this 
is to actually translate it into Khmer.

*In catalog manager, skip not to display the folder that doesn't have supported file

*Once file is saved, update the statistic of the currently opening file.

*Assign shortcut (Ctrl + %d) to copy the glossary definition to clipboard

*Assign shortcut to switch tab for plural tab in Detail view

*Make Pootling able to open ts file directly

*Test cases

*When open the project file, the file/directory paths for Catalog don't add to location list yet.
 Even the refresh button is clicked.

* Add the capability to have more than one file open at a time, being able to switch among them and easily copy terms.

* enable search to disregard the "&" character
 
*enable sorting to disregard "&" as well

* enable suggestions from other .po files to show up no matter whether they contain "&" or "[tab]" or keyboard shortcuts.

* Add translation to Translation Memory
