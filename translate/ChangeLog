	  auto-generating from setup.py

2004-04-23 22:57  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: in merge, merge comments rather than adding them
	  to avoid duplicates tried to improve fuzziness algorithm in merge

2004-04-23 22:54  davidfraser

	* tools/pomerge: used po merge method instead of doing it
	  ourselves...

2004-04-23 22:52  davidfraser

2004-04-23 22:50  davidfraser

	* __version__.py: version 0.7

2004-04-23 16:57  davidfraser

	  took out obsolete runconversion argument

2004-04-23 16:38  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: only clean after all tests (csvtests need stuff
	  from openofficetests)

2004-04-23 16:28  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: added method to pass certain command-line
	  options through to convertmethod as parameters

2004-04-23 15:26  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: made test-csv2po use standard oo templates
	  rather than af (which were .po not .pot)

2004-04-23 15:24  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, dtd2po.py, moz2po, po2dtd.py, po2moz,
	  po2prop.py, prop2po.py: removed convertmethod option from
	  runconversion (since this was a special case for single input and
	  output,  and we can determine it from the filenames or guess)
	  added removeduplicates call to oo2po

2004-04-22 12:50  davidfraser

	* convert/TODO: added TODO to handle originals in xpis

2004-04-20 11:51  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: added switches to only include localization files
	  from xpi - thus avoiding unneccessary commonprefix

2004-04-20 11:36  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: only check if template is a file if it is filled
	  in (could be None)

2004-04-16 18:25  davidfraser

	* convert/TODO: have done unpacking xpi added TODO to remove need
	  for -R switch

2004-04-16 15:13  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: replaced calls to get functions with calls to
	  open functions added TODO

2004-04-15 18:07  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: tried to replace old
	  getinput/output/templatefile methods with
	  openinput/output/templatefile (not tested!)

2004-04-15 18:02  davidfraser

	* convert/: Makefile, moz2po: added initial support for xpi
	  templates still need to support different filename structure
	  moved initialization of options.inputxpi

2004-04-15 17:40  davidfraser

	* convert/: Makefile, moz2po: removed -x switch from moz2po -
	  automatically detect xpi file / dir

2004-04-15 17:29  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: added code to convert to handle
	  temporary output files using StringIO now moz2po.convertfile is
	  not neccessary...

2004-04-15 17:14  davidfraser

	* convert/: moz2po, convert.py: changed recursefiles to just yield
	  list of inputpaths instead of output, templates, ext etc moved
	  generation of output names, template names, etc to
	  recurseconversion added methods openinputfile, openoutputfile,
	  opentemplatefile to open the files...  changed getconvertmethod
	  to take inputpath, outputpath instead of extensions improved
	  logic of gettemplatename (detect if not using templates here, not
	  outside) made moz2po simpler by overriding openinputfile also
	  don't need to checksubdir for every subdir in moz2po, just let
	  convert handle it

2004-04-15 16:22  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: added test for moz2po from xpi

2004-04-15 16:20  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: added methods
	  getfullinput/output/templatepath so they can be overridden in
	  derived classes (and overrode getinputpath in moz2po for xpi
	  files) this makes recurseconversion much simpler, so it doesn't
	  need to be overridden in moz2po improved directory creation
	  scheme (create a directory if we're going to create a file that
	  needs it)

2004-04-15 09:32  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: made non-xpi recursion return (otherwise it does
	  the standard thing, then tries the xpi thing too)

2004-04-15 09:15  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: added help to Makefile

2004-04-10 09:47  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: fixed wrong reference to base class added sys
	  import for warning output

2004-04-08 15:36  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: added initial code to handle reading files
	  straight out of an xpi

2004-04-08 15:32  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: initprogressbar needs to return allfiles as
	  sometimes it converts it from a generator to a list...

2004-04-08 13:56  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: refactored recurseconversion - was too
	  complex and difficult to override added methods initprogressbar
	  and convertfile

2004-04-04 08:05  davidfraser

	* portal/portaldb.py: fixed syntax error, name shadowing

2004-04-03 18:11  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: fixed wrong variable names

2004-03-31 09:13  davidfraser

	* filters/: checks.py, decoration.py: added checks for numbers

2004-03-31 09:00  davidfraser

	* filters/checks.py: separated quoting into singlequoting and
	  doublequoting removed unneccessary calls to
	  filterwordswithpunctuation prefilter

2004-03-31 08:56  davidfraser

	* filters/prefilters.py: added code to detect any apostrophe in the
	  middle of a word as not being punctuation
