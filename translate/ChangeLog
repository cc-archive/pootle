2006-06-12 13:10  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: We don't want unicode keys in dictionary

2006-06-12 10:15  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py, convert/po2dtd.py, convert/test_dtd2po.py,

	  test.  Uses simplistic regular expression which copes with 'I' at
	  the start of a sentence.

2006-06-12 09:10  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: [Forwardport] Double
	  variables no longer trip doublewords test.  Used removevariables
	  in test funtion and enabled disabled test.  [Forwardport]
	  disbaled acceleratedvariables tests.	Checks still in palce as
	  they should be moved to the accelerator test.

2006-06-12 06:53  davidfraser

	* storage/: dtd.py, test_dtd.py: convert to use base classes, some
	  cleanup some tests currently fail as the base class tests assume
	  construction of a unit without a location is valid for dtds, we
	  currently return a blank string if there is no .entity
	  (==location in other files) this needs to work better with base
	  class expectations

2006-06-12 06:51  davidfraser

	* storage/: properties.py, test_properties.py: remove propelement
	  stuff as it isn't used anywhere

2006-06-12 06:29  davidfraser

	* storage/: dtd.py, test_dtd.py: don't allow reentry of dtd quoted
	  strings - e.g. "test me""now" is actually invalid for now, just
	  ignore the reentry - in future, should raise an error

2006-06-12 06:29  davidfraser

	* misc/quote.py: [Forward port for wordforge-0-9] replace 0 and 1
	  arguments to extract and extractwithoutquotes with False and True
	  added allowreentry parameter to extract and extractwithoutquotes
	  (allows better DTD parsing) add default argument to escape in
	  extractwithoutquotes

2006-06-09 14:31  davidfraser

	* storage/ts.py: worked out how to override xml classes properly
	  (create our own expatbuilder etc etc) this means we don't any
	  longer modify the underlying classes note that writexml is not
	  overridden any more, but thats just a formatting issue

2006-06-09 14:26  davidfraser

	* storage/test_ts.py: added basic test for constructing ts file

2006-06-09 12:05  friedelwolff

	  (needed extra newline)

2006-06-08 00:31  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: [Forwardport] Disable acceleratedvariables
	  check - it never really worked and should actually be part of the

	  naming conventions

2006-06-05 16:23  friedelwolff

2006-06-02 17:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_po.py: test a bit of poheader functionality

2006-06-01 21:09  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: Enable tests for Bugs #115 and #116

2006-06-01 20:57  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, prefilters.py, test_checks.py: [Forwardport]
	  Allow variables to be deleted.  This is probably a suboptimal
	  approach but works - This fixes some simplecaps tests that are
	  now enabled We now ignore 'unchanged' items of len == 1 if the
	  word is in a notranslate list - Enabled test for this Remove a
	  bad stratcaps test

2006-06-01 19:16  davidfraser

	* storage/test_dtd.py: added test for roundtrip of quoting /
	  escaping problems

2006-06-01 16:41  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Correct test

2006-06-01 16:27  dwaynebailey

	* convert/html2po.py: Make sure that we split lines on <br> for a
	  better PO editing experience.

2006-06-01 14:53  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Can now handle the allcaps
	  case of simplecaps errors

2006-06-01 14:51  davidfraser

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: replace escaping/unescaping with
	  system that is actual symmetrical this utilises the new ability
	  of extractwithoutquotes to actually get the escaping via another
	  function fixed tests for msgid comments - they now expect a real
	  newline rather than \\n

2006-06-01 14:40  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: REmove KDE comments before
	  checking for capitals Changed failing simplecaps tests to use the
	  OOo checker as their failing most probably relates to the fact
	  that we do not remove variables when checking for capitals
	  (Removing vars is still TODO).

2006-06-01 14:36  davidfraser

	* misc/: quote.py, test_quote.py: change includeescapes to return
	  the actual escaped/unescaped value rather than simply whether to
	  escape it or not   (this probably requires an argument name
	  change, and better explanation - see change to
	  isnewlineortabescape in test)   the old method of returning a
	  boolean is still supported, but deprecated and needs removing
	  once fixed elsewhere	 this gives more flexibility in handling
	  escaping warn when invalid named unicode escapes are encountered,
	  rather than raising an error

2006-06-01 14:11  davidfraser

	* storage/test_po.py: added test that quoteforpo and unquotefrompo
	  round string strings properly (strings same as in test_base.py)

2006-06-01 13:54  friedelwolff

	* storage/test_base.py: Test string roundtripping

2006-06-01 13:06  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: decoration.py, test_decoration.py: Allow fullstops
	  inside a variables eg $pluginWizard.label;

2006-06-01 12:23  dwaynebailey

	* filters/prefilters.py: Make the regular expression consider
	  Unicode, so that \w identifies non-ascii letter characters.

2006-06-01 10:59  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py: Make sure we don't merge KDE comments if we find
	  them in the translation.

2006-06-01 10:46  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Add test to ensure that we merge KDE
	  disambiguations correctly.

2006-06-01 10:45  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pocount.py: Add UTF-8 header marker

2006-05-31 13:56  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_oo2po.py: Test of a \\r entry in helpcontent2 which
	  gets messed in PO as it appears as \\\r it makes the roundtrip
	  but its not actually what is required.  We really need \\\\r.

2006-05-31 13:46  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_oo.py: Test that we roundtrip \\r quotes properly.

2006-05-30 17:59  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: clarify parsestring usage (not a normal method)
	  don't overwrite filename if input doesn't really tell us a
	  filename

2006-05-30 15:39  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: use template for quoteforpo for plural targets too

2006-05-30 15:37  davidfraser

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: added test that checks the current
	  behaviour of setting target multistrings (the behaviour itself
	  needs checking, see the FIXME) make quoting with templates work
	  if self.msgstr is currently a plural dictionary but a singular
	  target is submitted

2006-05-24 11:44  friedelwolff

	* convert/: oo2po.py, test_oo2po.py: Handle \n, \t, and \r better.
	  Test differently for them.

2006-05-24 11:39  friedelwolff

	* storage/po.py: Handle \r just like \n and \t

2006-05-24 11:15  friedelwolff

	* storage/html.py: Add "content" as attribute to include (fix one
	  test)

2006-05-23 17:35  davidfraser

	* convert/: mozfunny2prop.py, prop2mozfunny.py:
	  mozillapropertiesencode now treats \n as part of the string, so
	  strip off any before passing and add back later

2006-05-23 17:22  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: avoid double-escaping quotes - they are
	  already escaped in escapeforpo

2006-05-23 17:20  davidfraser

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: added test for quoting problem that came
	  up in roundtrip

2006-05-23 17:09  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: remove empty lines at start or end of dtd

2006-05-23 17:06  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: ignore SYSTEM parameters (<!ENTITY % brandDTD
	  SYSTEM "chrome://...">)

2006-05-23 17:01  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: fix odd inconsistency in escaping characters add
	  TODO about changing encoding in msgid (just a check)

2006-05-23 16:51  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: handle inconsistency between mixed entities in
	  original and translation if an entity is mixed but not found in
	  the originals, delete it from mixed entities so it is just
	  treated ordinarily (these results in Nones being passed to
	  convertelement, which seems to make sense to return None from
	  rather than adding special cases before calling it)

2006-05-23 16:31  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: try to use underlying escapeforpo function
	  rather than escaping ourselves get rid of \r in dtd definitions
	  directly slight clean up of line stripping use .target property
	  which is simpler

2006-05-23 13:47  davidfraser

	* convert/test_prop2po.py: .source now represents \n as a newline
	  (although it is escaped in the underlying po file)

2006-05-23 13:45  davidfraser

	* misc/quote.py: make mozillapropertiesencode convert control
	  characters back to their escaped form this is safe now that the
	  whole line isn't passed through

2006-05-23 13:44  davidfraser

	* storage/properties.py: do stripping of end lines before handling
	  the line (this means we don't have to distinguish between real
	  endlines and escaped ones in the strings) only do
	  mozillapropertiesencode on the actual property values (this may
	  break keys that use it but I don't think I've seen that) only
	  strip spaces of properties so as not to strip of end lines

2006-05-23 13:42  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Some new tests to make sure we ignore
	  stuff that shouldn't be localised. Also some tests to make sure
	  we can reflow HTML properly and not end up with very odd
	  messgages.

2006-05-23 13:06  davidfraser

	* storage/dtd.py: try and ensure consistency in the number of blank
	  lines we output (successfully, it seems...)

2006-05-23 13:02  davidfraser

	* storage/test_dtd.py: try and be more consistent with other tests
	  (and pass!) by including a \n in the dtdsource for
	  test_comment_newline_space_closing

2006-05-23 12:56  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: cleaning up blank space

2006-05-23 12:53  davidfraser

	* storage/dtd.py: don't throw away comments and unparsed lines just
	  because no real entity followed them...  note that this adds a
	  number of new lines that we don't want, so fails tests, but the
	  failures aren't so bad and can be fixed

2006-05-23 12:46  davidfraser

	* misc/: quote.py, test_quote.py: tested extracting starting in a
	  string with a start/end quote the first character fixed lastpos
	  being initialized to 0 as this matches erroneously (None won't
	  match any position)

2006-05-17 00:58  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: When we merge from PO files with a literal
	  tab we end up converting tehm to \t which is incorrect.

2006-05-16 19:19  dwaynebailey

	* misc/quote.py: Recovering from SF CVS crash: Origianl 1.35
	  commit: The problem being corrected occurs when start and end
	  delimeters are not the same lenght eg in HTML <!-- (4) --> (3).
	  In this corner we have a line '[space]-->' and we are already in
	  the string.  So lastpos != pos = lenstart is 0 != 4 - 4 ie we get
	  confused.

	  I think this fix is correct in that it ignores the case when our
	  last delimeter was at pisition 0.  Because we only do this when
	  we are instring I don't think it will mess with other cases.

	  Original 1.36 commit: rather fix this by checking whether lastpos
	  really is a startdelim...

2006-05-16 14:55  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_po2csv.py: We should not be escaping \ escapes that
	  are already escaped.

2006-05-16 08:08  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_xliff2po.py: fix test: rename ids -> locations

2006-05-15 17:08  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: We should not get confused with variable
	  names that are also must translate words Unicode test for
	  musttranslate

2006-05-15 13:12  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pocount.py: Remove all the FIXME comments for things
	  that are now fixed.

2006-05-15 12:52  friedelwolff

	* tools/test_pocount.py: fix tab/spaces

2006-05-15 12:49  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: More tests: - Check that we don't include
	  ENTITY includes for translation - Check that we handle pretty
	  printed entities that have start and end blank newlines.

2006-05-15 08:28  friedelwolff

	* storage/ts.py: Comment out modifications to minidom classes

2006-05-07 08:58  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test the strange condition of losing
	  comments and subsequent entities if the preceding closing comment
	  is ^[space]-->

2006-05-07 08:53  dwaynebailey

	* misc/test_quote.py: Multiline comments in a dtd like this:

	  <!--	 Comment  --> <!ENTITY some.label "Blah">

	  End up losing the comment and all the following entities.  The
	  culprit is the space before the end comment marker.  If you
	  remove that then it extracts correctly.

	  This test uncovers the problem.  We're calling it line by line
	  from the parser in dtd.py and thus we are already in the string
	  with we need to extract.

	  This one is breaking our otherwise very good language packs.

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: Use double newlines in test for now

2006-05-04 09:22  dwaynebailey

	* filters/prefilters.py: This fixes a bug because sometimes we
	  supply 'unicode' not 'str' to the function.  This code is on a
	  critical path so I'd like someone to look at it and make it more
	  robust if possible.

	  I initially thought it might be related to multistring
	  functionality but it seems not.

2006-04-11 11:49  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Expamd 'long' and 'short'
	  test to cover instanaces of single characters.  ie a msgid of

	* filters/test_pofilter.py: -unused poexpected, some tabs-> spaces

2006-03-17 10:47  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: When we merge PO files we are removing
	  unassociated comments.  Ie comments in the original PO file
	  (template -t) that are not directly linked to a message.  So if
	  you have

	  # Unassociated comment

	  # Comment msgid "Blah" msgstr "Blee"

	  Then the output PO file will have the unassociated comment
	  removed.

2006-03-17 09:11  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Typo: excluefilters -> excludefilters

2006-03-16 17:12  dwaynebailey

2006-03-15 23:35  friedelwolff

	* misc/wStringIO.py, storage/po.py, filters/test_pofilter.py:
	  Commit workaround for headerless po's. See
	  filters/test_pofilter.py::test_unicode

2006-03-15 21:50  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_pofilter.py: If there is no header specifying the
	  encoding then pofilter gets very confused.  This test tries to
	  parse a UTF-8 snippet and the lack of encoding information
	  confuses pofilter.

2006-03-15 21:39  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: No need to remove variables when checking for
	  double spacing problems.

2006-03-14 21:07  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_po.py: We should be able to obsolete message when we
	  retire them, otherwise our Pootle PO files just grow and grow.

2006-03-14 20:15  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Automatic comments are never merged,
	  they are overwritten by the new file.  Which makes sense since
	  they come from the source code and shouldn't be edited but at the
	  source.

2006-03-14 16:38  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Separate automactic comments (#.)
	  from other comments (#[space]).  This will allow us to do more
	  Gettext like operations on our PO files such as merging #.

2006-03-14 15:22  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Test to check that we merge automatic
	  comments (#.) correctly.

	* convert/dtd2po.py: Now also handle cases where DONT_TRANSLATE is
	  followed by some other explanatory text

2006-03-07 23:25  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: test_dtd.py, test_properties.py: Added some tests
	  picked up during roundtripping Mozilla -> moz2po -> po2moz -> New
	  files

	  - Comments that appear on the same line as an entity definition
	  should remain in that position in our generated files - We are
	  losing hard coded \n at the start and end of properties
	  defintions

2006-03-07 22:25  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test to check that we can handle entitie
	  reference eg &blah; in the DTD file.

2006-03-07 15:08  dwaynebailey

	  source location styles

2006-03-07 12:22  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Som new tests that pick up problems with:
	  - endpunc - not all punctuation is considered - singlequotes - 'n
	  in Afrikaans is confusing this one when they should have been
	  removed - variabkes - entities with dots eg &file.name; are not
	  checked

2006-03-06 23:39  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py: Revert #: merging code.  It didn't work so good.

2006-03-06 23:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/: html2po.py, test_html2po.py: Add duplicate handling to
	  html2po.  This is a good thingTM.  We can now begin to look at
	  adding xhtml as a convertor for moz2po

2006-03-06 22:29  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Add helpers countunits and compareunit
	  Convert all test to use the helpers Remove some unuseful tests
	  Add a command line testing class inheritect from test_convert Add
	  test_help

2006-03-06 12:03  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py: In object entities the standby attribute should
	  be translated.  The attr tags will probably come into their own
	  when we can compress entities to show a translator only the bit
	  they should change.  Till then its in here more for tracking.

2006-03-06 11:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py, convert/html2po.py, convert/test_html2po.py: Add
	  a number of new tags:  h4, h5, h6, th, dt, dd, address, caption
	  Removed:  span, lang Addeded attrs:  summary

	  This should give us full covererage of tables.  Removing 'lang'
	  removes a number of spurious errors.

	  xhtml is now a valid suffix for files processed by html2po

	  Cleanup test_html.py Made all tests work Added tests for all the
	  new tags added

2006-03-06 02:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add a failing DONT_TRANSLATE style Test
	  how we handle .acceskeys that are mimatched ie don't appear in
	  .label Check the the .source is correct when we fold normal
	  access keys

2006-03-03 22:36  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py, tools/test_pomerge.py: Allow source comments to be
	  split at the line level and then merged.  This ensures that we
	  don't duplicate source locations if they appear in two different
	  styles eg one per line merged with multiple per line.

2006-03-03 15:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/: html.py, properties.py, xliff.py: Fix up accidental

	  variables in quotes eg \"%S\" (this passes)

2006-03-02 19:56  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_csv2po.py: Whoops it actually is 'comment' not
	  'source'

2006-03-02 19:24  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_csv2po.py: Make sure we can see the source when we
	  fail checks in singleelement.  Correct the header: the first
	  column is called 'source' not 'comment'.  Make sure we test with
	  and without the header

2006-03-02 11:29  davidfraser

	* filters/: decoration.py, test_decoration.py: modified
	  decoration.find_marked_variables to be able to handle 0-length
	  variable markers (# or % in openoffice) added simple test for
	  this to new test_decoration module this now makes the checks for
	  those variables pass in test_checks

	* convert/po2csv.py, storage/csvl10n.py, storage/test_base.py,
	  storage/test_csvl10n.py: fixed up handling spreadsheet escapes -
	  do it in the base class, not the converter also add in escapes
	  when generating source added more detailed output when error in
	  comparing sources (and fix comparing source2 units to source2
	  units instead of source1 units!)

2006-02-28 15:12  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Ensure that we remove KDE
	  comments before checking if something is untranslated (also added
	  test) Allow numbers to be reordered (also added test Added test
	  for messages that are blank but contain a KDE comment
