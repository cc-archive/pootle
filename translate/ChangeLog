	  options.outputoptions which are then used to determine names
	  instead of self.inputformats, self.outputoptions also changed
	  getformathelp so it doesn't actually modify the format
	  dictionaries...

2004-05-20 20:22  dwaynebailey

	* convert/dtd2po.py: For msgid's that are blank a correct KDE style

	* storage/xpi.py: added spacing between functions

2004-05-10 18:57  davidfraser

	* convert/po2moz: if you don't close the outputxpi you never get

	  translations the paths still need to be fixed up though...

2004-05-10 18:50  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, po2moz: tried to add more intelligence to

	  added ability to po2moz, moz2po to handle non-dtd, non-properties
	  files by copying them added ability to po2moz to handle xpi files
	  for templates   - po2moz now has a MozConvertOptionParser like
	  moz2po does, but it does some different stuff renamed methods
	  recursefiles to recurseinputfiles, etc in convert made convert
	  methods return lists instead of yielding generators added
	  copyinput, copytemplate methods to convert that can be used to
	  copy files

2004-05-10 17:34  davidfraser

2004-05-07 16:49  davidfraser

	  formats in convert this allows more sanity and flexibility
	  basically formats expects a dictionary with keys either as
	  inputformats or (inputformat, templateformat) tuples and values
	  as tuples of (outputformat, convertmethod) this obliviates the
	  need of ConvertOptionParseExt

	  planning to use them for input

2004-05-04 15:26  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: make sure commonprefix doesn't swallow up a whole
	  file changed default extractdir to prevent errors...

2004-05-04 15:14  davidfraser

	  is called from __del__ it can't see the class or anything except
	  for self) all explained nicely in comments

2004-05-04 14:03  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: create directories if required in extraction

	* convert/: Makefile, convert.py: added code to handle input and
	  output parameters without needing -i/-o (decided it was better in

2004-04-30 16:05  davidfraser

	* tools/pomerge: use new simpler parser.runconversion() to run the
	  operation

2004-04-30 16:00  davidfraser

2004-04-30 14:51  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: tried to improve intelligence of
	  recursion detection (recurse iff the input is a directory) allow

	  moz2po with isxpi

2004-04-29 17:31  davidfraser

	* convert/TODO: added TODO to handle originals in xpis

2004-04-20 11:51  davidfraser

	* tools/detectencoding: don't store options that we can just use
	  straight from self.options moved filename init from __init__ to
	  recursefiles only print filename if verbose added lots of
	  docstrings changed names of functions (especially handle...) to
	  make it clearer

2004-04-16 14:47  davidfraser

	* tools/detectencoding: added option for ignorecase (so we don't do
	  lower unless ignorecase is true)

2004-04-16 14:43  davidfraser

	* tools/detectencoding: added code to fuzzymatch to count
	  correspondence of chars, print out results

2004-04-16 14:29  davidfraser

	  in fuzzymatch simplified printout of fuzzymatch (only one
	  encoding)

2004-04-16 14:22  davidfraser

	* tools/detectencoding: split fuzzymatch off from testwordstats,
	  made it a different test fixed some bugs (decodedwords was

	  added docstring for testcharstats

2004-04-16 14:07  davidfraser

	* tools/detectencoding: factored out makecountmap method add
	  docstring for fuzzy

	  options

2004-04-16 13:20  davidfraser

	* tools/detectencoding: moved listencodings, options into detector
	  class changed testencodings to testcharstats added testwordstats,
	  also handles fuzzy word matching added options to select tests
	  added limitencodings option

2004-04-15 18:07  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: tried to replace old
	  getinput/output/templatefile methods with
	  openinput/output/templatefile (not tested!)

2004-04-15 18:02  davidfraser

	* convert/: Makefile, moz2po: added initial support for xpi
	  templates still need to support different filename structure
	  moved initialization of options.inputxpi

2004-04-15 17:40  davidfraser

	* convert/: Makefile, moz2po: removed -x switch from moz2po -
	  automatically detect xpi file / dir

2004-04-15 17:34  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added actual xpi filename into name of
	  inputstream

2004-04-15 17:29  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: added code to convert to handle
	  temporary output files using StringIO now moz2po.convertfile is
	  not neccessary...

2004-04-15 17:14  davidfraser

	* convert/: moz2po, convert.py: changed recursefiles to just yield
	  list of inputpaths instead of output, templates, ext etc moved
	  generation of output names, template names, etc to
	  recurseconversion added methods openinputfile, openoutputfile,
	  opentemplatefile to open the files...  changed getconvertmethod
	  to take inputpath, outputpath instead of extensions improved
	  logic of gettemplatename (detect if not using templates here, not
	  outside) made moz2po simpler by overriding openinputfile also
	  don't need to checksubdir for every subdir in moz2po, just let
	  convert handle it

2004-04-15 16:46  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added clever trickery so streams can have names
	  like normal files (so for example a converted po file will
	  contain the 'name' of the .dtd file from inside the xpi)

2004-04-15 16:22  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: added test for moz2po from xpi

2004-04-15 16:20  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: added methods
	  getfullinput/output/templatepath so they can be overridden in
	  derived classes (and overrode getinputpath in moz2po for xpi
	  files) this makes recurseconversion much simpler, so it doesn't
	  need to be overridden in moz2po improved directory creation
	  scheme (create a directory if we're going to create a file that
	  needs it)

2004-04-15 10:13  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: fixed bug with giving reduce an initial value -
	  limits the result thus commonprefix wasn't working...

2004-04-15 09:32  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: made non-xpi recursion return (otherwise it does
	  the standard thing, then tries the xpi thing too)

2004-04-15 09:15  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: added help to Makefile

2004-04-10 09:47  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: fixed wrong reference to base class added sys
	  import for warning output

2004-04-10 09:18  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: gave initial value to reduce to prevent error on
	  empty list in commonprefix

2004-04-08 15:36  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: added initial code to handle reading files
	  straight out of an xpi

2004-04-08 15:32  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: initprogressbar needs to return allfiles as
	  sometimes it converts it from a generator to a list...

2004-04-08 15:04  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added openinputstream method for getting a
	  file-like input stream from a file (inside the xpi or an inner
	  jar) added includedirs parameter to iterextractnames

2004-04-08 14:32  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added functions jartoospath and ostojarpath that
	  handle finding files inside jars

2004-04-08 13:56  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: refactored recurseconversion - was too
	  complex and difficult to override added methods initprogressbar
	  and convertfile

2004-04-08 11:12  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: modified _commonprefix to handle strings as well
	  as lists use it to simplify jarprefixes (strip leading
	  languagename-)

2004-04-08 11:04  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: a lot of refactoring extracted _commonprefix
	  method added a XpiFile constructor that reads out the important
	  information cache jarfiles in self.jarfiles so they aren't
	  extracted repeatedly added stripcommonprefix, findjarprefixes
	  methods added ziptoospath, ostozippath methods this all
	  simplifies iterextractnames a lot
