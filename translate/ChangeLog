2006-06-09 14:32  davidfraser

	  (create our own expatbuilder etc etc) this means we don't any
	  longer modify the underlying classes note that writexml is not

	  (originally developed and tested here, forward ported to HEAD,
	  then copied back...)

2006-06-09 14:27  davidfraser

2006-06-09 12:53  davidfraser

	  functions

2006-06-09 12:49  davidfraser

	  storage/test_dtd.py: added default argument for escape to
	  extractwithoutquotes support includeescapes function returning
	  the replaced version of an escaped character use
	  extractwithoutquotes in dtd extraction added test for
	  roundtripping directly on dtd quoting functions test_po2dtd test

	  (needed extra newline)

	  but works - This fixes some simplecaps tests that are now enabled
	  We now ignore 'unchanged' items of len == 1 if the word is in a
	  notranslate list - Enabled test for this Remove a bad stratcaps
	  test

2006-06-01 18:17  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_oo2po.py: [backport] test_escapes_helpcontent2, test

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: [Backport] Remove KDE
	  comments before checking for capitals Changed failing simplecaps
	  tests to use the OOo checker as their failing most probably
	  relates to the fact that we do not remove variables when checking
	  for capitals (Removing vars is still TODO).

2006-06-01 13:07  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: decoration.py, test_decoration.py: [Backport] Allow
	  fullstops inside a variables eg &pluginWizard.label;

	  convert/pot2po.py, storage/po.py, storage/test_po.py: renamed
	  getids to getlocations to align with HEAD (not a full backport as
	  not renaming internal objects or putting this on base class yet)

2006-06-01 11:53  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_pofilter.py: Mark a string as unicode

2006-06-01 11:48  davidfraser

	* storage/properties.py: [Backported from HEAD] - fixes required
	  given quote.py backport, and fixes other bugs do stripping of end
	  lines before handling the line (this means we don't have to
	  distinguish between real endlines and escaped ones in the
	  strings) only do mozillapropertiesencode on the actual property
	  values (this may break keys that use it but I don't think I've
	  seen that) only strip spaces of properties so as not to strip of
	  end lines

2006-06-01 11:45  davidfraser

	* misc/: quote.py, test_quote.py: Backported quote improvements
	  from HEAD. Changes below:   - performance improvements to extract
	  and extractwithoutquotes in quote.py	   * use find_all to
	  precache important locations in string rather than running find
	  over and over     * use the significant locations we find to hop
	  and skip through the string ...      * simplify rstripeol	 *
	  improved docstrings	 - fixes to quote.py	  * added fix for
	  startdelim directly following enddelim (needs to handle in same
	  loop)      * fixed lastpos being initialized to 0 as this matches
	  erroneously	 - changes to behaviour in quote.py	 * changed
	  expected behaviour of hanging escape in
	  extractwithoutquotes(includeescapes=False)	  * make
	  mozillapropertiesencode convert control characters back to their
	  escaped form	      (this is safe now that the whole line isn't
	  passed through)      * handle no escape (and make default
	  argument) in extract	  - improved test_quote.py	* added
	  tests for find_all and extract      * added extra quote to
	  test_extract, and added test_extractwithoutquotes	 * added
	  test for quotes starting just after closing, more escape handling
	  tests      * took out TODO for failing test	   * add test for
	  extractwithoutquotes being given a function that determines
	  whether or not to include a given escape	* added tests for
	  multiline comments in a dtd with a (newline, space) before the
	  end comment marker	  * tested extracting starting in a string
	  with a start/end quote as the first character

	  these tests now all pass, and don't seem to cause any other
	  failures on the branch (have fixed one in storage/properties.py)

2006-06-01 11:30  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: [Backport] pomerge tests.  Disables all
	  xliff merging tests.	There were major changes to pomerge related
	  to getting xliff merging working, and so we've ignored them.
	  Also most changes seems to also relate to fundamental string
	  management and internal naming convention changes, thus again
	  pomerge merging has been ignored.

2006-06-01 11:17  friedelwolff

	* storage/dtd.py: [backport] fix for
	  test_reference_entity_in_source

2006-06-01 11:13  davidfraser

	  passing list to rstripeol which only worked by fluke)

2006-06-01 11:12  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py: [Backport] automatic removal of KDE comments from
	  target string.  Had to change regex slightly, most probably
	  related to internal string handling changes in HEAD

2006-06-01 10:49  davidfraser

	* misc/: multistring.py, test_multistring.py: add support (and
	  tests) for .replace() [Friedel Wolff, backported from HEAD]

	  (bug 118)

2006-05-05 16:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_mozfunny2prop.py: file test_mozfunny2prop.py was

	  inc files (just converting to properties, not back, so added TODO

2006-04-11 11:49  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Expamd 'long' and 'short'
	  test to cover instanaces of single characters.  ie a msgid of
	  length 1 will trigger a 'long' error if the msgstr is longer then

	* tools/test_pogrep.py: Add unicode checking for when we do regex
	  checking

2006-03-23 12:22  friedelwolff

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add test for a DTD that has an

2006-03-19 14:59  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_pofilter.py: -unused poexpected, some tabs-> spaces

2006-03-17 10:47  dwaynebailey

	* tools/test_pomerge.py: When we merge PO files we are removing
	  unassociated comments.  Ie comments in the original PO file
	  (template -t) that are not directly linked to a message.  So if
	  you have

	  # Unassociated comment

	  # Comment msgid "Blah" msgstr "Blee"

	  Then the output PO file will have the unassociated comment
	  removed.

2006-03-17 09:11  friedelwolff

	* filters/checks.py: Typo: excluefilters -> excludefilters

2006-03-16 17:12  dwaynebailey

	  for po2moz and po2html

2006-03-15 23:35  friedelwolff

	* misc/wStringIO.py, storage/po.py, filters/test_pofilter.py:
	  Commit workaround for headerless po's. See
	  filters/test_pofilter.py::test_unicode

2006-03-15 21:50  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_pofilter.py: If there is no header specifying the
	  encoding then pofilter gets very confused.  This test tries to
	  parse a UTF-8 snippet and the lack of encoding information
	  confuses pofilter.

2006-03-15 21:39  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: No need to remove variables when checking for
	  double spacing problems.

2006-03-15 21:31  dwaynebailey

2006-03-14 21:07  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_po.py: We should be able to obsolete message when we
	  retire them, otherwise our Pootle PO files just grow and grow.

2006-03-14 20:15  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Automatic comments are never merged,
	  they are overwritten by the new file.  Which makes sense since
	  they come from the source code and shouldn't be edited but at the
	  source.

2006-03-14 16:38  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: po.py, test_po.py: Separate automactic comments (#.)
	  from other comments (#[space]).  This will allow us to do more
	  Gettext like operations on our PO files such as merging #.
	  comments properly (new comment overrides the old comment)

2006-03-14 15:22  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_pot2po.py: Test to check that we merge automatic
	  comments (#.) correctly.

	  should be translated :( Probably needs to be corrected.

2006-03-08 16:20  dwaynebailey

	* convert/dtd2po.py: Now also handle cases where DONT_TRANSLATE is
	  followed by some other explanatory text

2006-03-07 23:25  dwaynebailey

	* storage/: test_dtd.py, test_properties.py: Added some tests
	  picked up during roundtripping Mozilla -> moz2po -> po2moz -> New
	  files

	  - Comments that appear on the same line as an entity definition
	  should remain in that position in our generated files - We are
	  losing hard coded \n at the start and end of properties
	  defintions

2006-03-07 22:25  dwaynebailey

	* storage/test_dtd.py: Test to check that we can handle entitie
	  reference eg &blah; in the DTD file.

2006-03-07 15:08  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py, convert/test_html2po.py: Allow the abbr tag to

	  source location styles

2006-03-07 12:22  dwaynebailey

	* filters/test_checks.py: Som new tests that pick up problems with:
	  - endpunc - not all punctuation is considered - singlequotes - 'n
	  in Afrikaans is confusing this one when they should have been
	  removed - variabkes - entities with dots eg &file.name; are not
	  checked

2006-03-06 23:39  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py: Revert #: merging code.  It didn't work so good.

2006-03-06 23:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/: html2po.py, test_html2po.py: Add duplicate handling to
	  html2po.  This is a good thingTM.  We can now begin to look at
	  adding xhtml as a convertor for moz2po

2006-03-06 22:29  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_html2po.py: Add helpers countunits and compareunit
	  Convert all test to use the helpers Remove some unuseful tests
	  Add a command line testing class inheritect from test_convert Add
	  test_help

2006-03-06 12:03  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py: In object entities the standby attribute should
	  be translated.  The attr tags will probably come into their own
	  when we can compress entities to show a translator only the bit
	  they should change.  Till then its in here more for tracking.

2006-03-06 11:05  dwaynebailey

	* storage/html.py, convert/html2po.py, convert/test_html2po.py: Add
	  a number of new tags:  h4, h5, h6, th, dt, dd, address, caption
	  Removed:  span, lang Addeded attrs:  summary

	  This should give us full covererage of tables.  Removing 'lang'
	  removes a number of spurious errors.

	  xhtml is now a valid suffix for files processed by html2po

	  Cleanup test_html.py Made all tests work Added tests for all the
	  new tags added

2006-03-06 02:02  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_dtd2po.py: Add a failing DONT_TRANSLATE style Test
	  how we handle .acceskeys that are mimatched ie don't appear in
	  .label Check the the .source is correct when we fold normal
	  access keys

2006-03-03 22:36  dwaynebailey

	* storage/po.py, tools/test_pomerge.py: Allow source comments to be
	  split at the line level and then merged.  This ensures that we
	  don't duplicate source locations if they appear in two different
	  styles eg one per line merged with multiple per line.

2006-03-03 15:48  friedelwolff

	* storage/: html.py, properties.py, xliff.py: Fix up accidental

	  variables in quotes eg \"%S\" (this passes)

2006-03-02 19:56  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_csv2po.py: Whoops it actually is 'comment' not
	  'source'

2006-03-02 19:24  dwaynebailey

	* convert/test_csv2po.py: Make sure we can see the source when we
	  fail checks in singleelement.  Correct the header: the first
	  column is called 'source' not 'comment'.  Make sure we test with
	  and without the header

2006-03-02 11:29  davidfraser

	* filters/: decoration.py, test_decoration.py: modified
	  decoration.find_marked_variables to be able to handle 0-length
	  variable markers (# or % in openoffice) added simple test for
	  this to new test_decoration module this now makes the checks for
	  those variables pass in test_checks

	* convert/po2csv.py, storage/csvl10n.py, storage/test_base.py,
	  storage/test_csvl10n.py: fixed up handling spreadsheet escapes -
	  do it in the base class, not the converter also add in escapes
	  when generating source added more detailed output when error in
	  comparing sources (and fix comparing source2 units to source2
	  units instead of source1 units!)

2006-02-28 15:12  dwaynebailey

	* filters/: checks.py, test_checks.py: Ensure that we remove KDE
	  comments before checking if something is untranslated (also added
	  test) Allow numbers to be reordered (also added test Added test
	  for messages that are blank but contain a KDE comment
