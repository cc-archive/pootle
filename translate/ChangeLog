2004-11-12 14:00  davidfraser

	* tools/: pocount.py, pogrep.py: pychecker fixes:   sum is only
	  needed if builtin is not defined   logic in pogrep for multiple
	  msgstrs was wrong (using thepo.msgstr instead of each item)

2004-11-12 13:55  davidfraser

	* convert/README: removed README (we have docs\!)

2004-11-12 13:54  davidfraser

	* filters/: checks.py, decoration.py: TeeChecker should use the

	  unneccessary import of sre, unused variable

2004-11-12 13:53  davidfraser

	* convert/: csv2po.py, html2po.py, nb2po.py, oo2po.py, po2html.py,
	  po2nb.py, po2txt.py, sxw2po.py, txt2po.py: only import the
	  convert module in the main method throughout some pychecker
	  fixups:   made constructors for conversion classes that need wrap
	  parameters   remove unneccessary imports of os, sre modules
	  txt2po didn't have a proper main method

2004-11-12 13:40  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, oo2po.py, po2oo.py: made oo2po, po2oo treat
	  any input file as a multifile archive (not just .gsi/.sdf/.txt)
	  implemented this by using None to refer to any file, but not
	  existing directories so to output to a directory tree, just make
	  sure the output directory exists

2004-11-12 10:03  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py: added better intelligence to handle kde comments
	  (they end at the \\n) this could probably use further
	  improvement...

2004-11-12 09:40  dwaynebailey

	  scripts into script / module parts

2004-11-10 10:18  davidfraser

	* storage/po.py, tools/pocount: pocount: use poelement class
	  methods rather than handling strings ourselves as that breaks
	  with plurals calculated length of msgstr correctly when used on
	  plurals (failed before)

2004-11-10 10:01  dwaynebailey

	* convert/po2csv.py: Incorrectly calling convertcsv

2004-11-10 09:13  davidfraser

	  of translation session, factored out getitem method made argdict
	  a member of TranslatePage, to simplify access added Edit link for
	  each item that lets you go straight to edit that item

2004-11-10 08:53  davidfraser

	* pootle/: indexpage.py, projects.py, server.py: pass argdict in to
	  ProjectIndex, use that for showchecks rather than a special
	  variable use showchecks parameter rather than checks.html to
	  determine checking allow ProjectIndex to work on a single file

	  handle individual po files

2004-11-10 08:30  davidfraser

	* pootle/: TODO, indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py:
	  instead of translate page defaulting to quick translate, pass
	  fuzzy and blank as parameters similarly projects code doesn't
	  default to fuzzy & blank, it defaults to matchnames=[] which
	  allows everything DONE: renamed start translate

2004-11-10 08:19  davidfraser

	* pootle/indexpage.py: changed "Start Translating" to "Quick
	  Translate" Don't show the name of the file everywhere for PO

	  po2txt.py, sxw2po, sxw2po.py, txt2po, txt2po.py: massive
	  reorganization to make sure all code is accessible via module, so
	  the files not ending in .py are just scripts to call a main
	  method in a module

	* pootle/TODO: Added pootle TODO

2004-11-08 17:40  davidfraser

2004-11-03 09:18  davidfraser

	* filters/pofilter: added code to be able to exclude fuzzy / review
	  elements from filtering entirely [Dwayne Bailey] this still
	  probably needs more refinement alongside the filter checks for
	  fuzzy / review

2004-11-03 09:13  davidfraser

	* filters/checks.py: filteraccelerators when checking unchanged, so
	  just changing the accelerator doesn't qualify as a real change
	  [Dwayne Bailey]

2004-11-02 11:25  dwaynebailey

	* filters/checks.py: Mozilla variable checks cahnged "#, None" to

	  you can compare files more easily

2004-10-28 15:07  davidfraser

	* misc/optrecurse.py: fixed check for whether we need to know the
	  number of files (console was old option) should now go to 100% in
	  default case (was just using count instead of percent because of
	  this)

2004-10-28 10:26  davidfraser

	* convert/translatepath.py, filters/pofilter, filters/pogrep,
	  filters/translatepath.py, tools/pomerge, tools/translatepath.py:
	  removed all remaining translatepath stuff

2004-10-28 10:09  davidfraser

	  fall off the end if no more pofilenames could be found

2004-10-27 21:08  davidfraser

	* pootle/: indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, server.py,

2004-10-25 11:58  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: when an item is submitted, store the

	  make apache multi-process servers pass state between processes

2004-10-25 11:46  davidfraser

	* pootle/translatepage.py: jToolkit has problems with non-unicode
	  in the TextArea ; manually decoding to unicode for now

2004-10-25 11:08  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: added quick route to find next pofilename

2004-10-25 10:57  davidfraser

	* pootle/: pagelayout.py, server.py: added spearch url for login
	  page which redirects back to the index if logged in (this is

	* pootle/server.py: added an OptionalLoginAppServer that makes
	  login optional

2004-10-25 10:25  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: need to convert the statsmtime to an integer
	  otherwise it'll never match

2004-10-25 09:53  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: took out __init__ loop through self.pofiles
	  (should have been self.pofilename) as it would have been too
	  expensive but it wasn't doing anything as self.pofiles was empty
	  moved pofile.classify construction to getpofile as we always need
	  the classifications available

2004-10-23 20:26  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: use matchnames for searching for next item,
	  to make it superfast :-)

2004-10-23 20:09  davidfraser

	* pootle/: indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: replaced
	  translated, total with named stats in a dictionary also keep in
	  each pofile a classify member that keeps named lists of elements
	  matching fuzzy, blank, etc this should be useful in optimizing
	  searches added more info on blank, fuzzy to the sidebar of the
	  translation page

2004-10-23 19:47  davidfraser

	* pootle/: indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: more
	  detailed statistics invalidate statistics when a file changes

2004-10-23 19:40  davidfraser

	  calculate absolute path when needing to access files

2004-10-23 19:33  davidfraser

	* pootle/: pagelayout.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: added
	  pofilename to the links at the side (made them accessible as
	  PootlePage members) rearranged test for what is translated

2004-10-23 19:26  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: separated out receivetranslation so the
	  actual changes are done from the TranslationProject made new
	  savefile function which saves the pofile to disk   currently
	  saving after each change which is not ideal added doc strings

2004-10-23 19:19  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: added findnextitem which searches and filters
	  options through a function this can be slow if you do what it
	  does at the moment and searches for blank msgstrs...	we should
	  use the stats to filter out files automatically...

2004-10-23 19:08  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: moved logic about moving to next item from
	  session into project

2004-10-23 14:57  davidfraser

	* pootle/: indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: created new
	  class TranslationSession which represents a users work on a
	  project use this to keep track of current po file, item rather
	  than doing it globally in the project added the pofilename as a
	  hidden field so we know what item is being translated exactly
	  store translatable elements in pofile.transelements for each
	  pofile to make indexing easier rather than returning items before
	  and after with the translatable item, query for them separately
	  also changed projects.getproject to only take the subproject
	  config item

2004-10-23 13:58  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: added call to initstatscache so it is
	  actually used :-) and make sure the right filenames etc are
	  passed so that it actually reads the files...

2004-10-23 13:54  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: added primitive means of caching statistics
	  in .stats files with timestamps

2004-10-23 13:43  davidfraser

	* pootle/: indexpage.py, projects.py, translatepage.py: read all
	  pofiles in when TranslationProject is constructed added
	  calculation and display of statistics ; this is currently very
	  slow! renamed projects.getiterator to getproject

2004-10-23 13:15  davidfraser

	* pootle/projects.py: added code to iterate through all the files
	  in a directory tree rather than just one pofile this changes the
	  pref name to podir fixed up getiterator to not use self
	  everywhere...

2004-10-23 12:57  davidfraser

	* pootle/: projects.py, translatepage.py: moved TranslationIterator
	  code into separate projects module, from whence it will be
	  transmogrified

2004-10-23 12:46  davidfraser

	* pootle/indexpage.py: count the subprojects

2004-10-23 12:45  davidfraser

	* pootle/server.py: added login, LoginPage that looks pootley

2004-10-22 15:54  davidfraser

	* misc/wStringIO.py: catch error trying to do getvalue on closed
	  files... (self.buf is gone because we delete it) this can happen
	  if for example a CatchStringOutput has close() called twice...

2004-10-22 15:47  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: don't close files we copy because the
	  processfile module does that anyway...  make processfile check
	  that files aren't a tty (as the copy file did...) (not sure if
	  this is neccessary but can't hurt)

2004-10-22 14:15  dwaynebailey

	* tools/pocount: - Laoyout is now more readable with similar items
	  grouped in columns.  - Introduced a translated count so that we
	  can get better total figures - Entries marked fuzzy and which are
	  untranslated are no longer double counted.	A n entry is fuzzy
	  if it is marked fuzzy and in not untranslated. This change
	  also makes it easier to total and evaluate figures.

2004-10-22 11:46  davidfraser

	* pootle/: server.py, translatepage.py: added hook to receive new
	  translations calculate translation items correctly, made the row
	  offset equal to the item in the file

2004-10-22 11:14  davidfraser

	* pootle/translatepage.py: removed dummytranslations, now uses
	  subproject.pofile to get translations from also fixed up some row
	  calculation problems

2004-10-22 10:51  davidfraser

	* pootle/: __init__.py, indexpage.py, pagelayout.py, server.py,
	  translatepage.py: added initial pootle implementation (with
	  random dummy bork translations)

2004-10-21 17:20  davidfraser

	* convert/po2moz: open the outputarchive in write mode if it
	  doesn't exist oh, and translatepath doesn't work...

2004-10-19 13:46  davidfraser

	* filters/pofilter: remove -x and change --exclude to
	  --excludefilter to prevent option with main optrecurse
	  -x/--exclude option for folders

2004-10-18 19:46  davidfraser

	* convert/csv2po, convert/dtd2po.py, convert/html2po,
	  convert/moz2po, convert/nb2po, convert/oo2po, convert/po2csv,
	  convert/po2dtd.py, convert/po2html, convert/po2moz,

	  convert/txt2po, filters/pofilter, filters/pogrep,
	  filters/translatepath.py, tools/pocount, tools/pomerge,
	  tools/translatepath.py: added translatepath to all the tools,
	  which tries to find the right directory and add it to the python
	  path if translate can't be imported. one of these lives in each
	  directory with executable scripts in them so they can find it
	  automatically

2004-10-18 19:37  davidfraser

	* ChangeLog: updated ChangeLog to 0.8rc1

2004-10-04 16:39  davidfraser

	* __version__.py: version 0.8 RC1

2004-10-04 16:37  davidfraser

	* storage/oo.py: refactored oomultifile to work both as input file
	  and as output file added 'mode' argument ('w' for writing, also
	  done if file doesn't exist and mode is None) uses
	  wStringIO.CatchStringOutput to write output file contents...

2004-10-04 16:32  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, po2moz: added support for excluding files
	  to convert.py (with -x/--exclude switch) added direct support for
	  output archives to convert.py, moved some code out of po2moz /
	  refactored (this will be used in po2oo too) close output files in
	  processfile for ArchiveConvertOptionParser, since they may be
	  subfiles...  also added support for passing kwargs through
	  openarchive (so far just mode='w' is needed)

2004-10-04 16:29  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py, misc/wStringIO.py: moved CatchStringOutput from
	  xpi to wStringIO

2004-10-04 09:21  davidfraser

	* misc/optrecurse.py: added an --exclude (or -x) option, so that
	  for example you can ignore CVS directories.  Supports pattern
	  matching e.g. *.bak

2004-10-01 16:14  davidfraser

	* storage/oo.py, convert/oo2po: made it so oo2po po files now
	  contain the original oo pseudo-filename in the comment at the top

2004-10-01 15:41  davidfraser

	* convert/: oo2po, po2oo: include the resourcetype in the key to
	  prevent overlapping keys made escaping consistent and workable so
	  that the round trip is always correct

2004-10-01 15:35  davidfraser

	* misc/quote.py: took out odd method of not using escapes, do it
	  sensibly

2004-10-01 12:12  davidfraser

	* convert/: oo2po, po2oo: reduce the keys so it only contains the
	  base filename (the project and  directory are in the po file
	  name)

2004-10-01 11:44  davidfraser

	* storage/oo.py: updated to work with
	  convert.ArchiveConvertOptionParser made it able to handle input
	  file name more cross-platform path generation iterator, in
	  operator, openfile renamed to openinputfile

2004-10-01 11:41  davidfraser

	* convert/: oo2po, po2oo: added .txt as extension for oomultifiles

2004-09-30 17:22  davidfraser

	* convert/oo2po: support gsi and sdf extensions as archives

2004-09-30 17:20  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: check if templates are used before trying to
	  access options.templates, to prevent error...

2004-09-30 16:58  davidfraser

	* convert/oo2po: switched to use convert.ArchiveConvertOptionParser
	  (since it is the revamped MozCOP that GSICOP was based on)

2004-09-30 12:47  davidfraser

	* convert/oo2po: added a TODO

2004-09-30 11:52  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po, po2moz: refactored as much as
	  possible from MozConvertOptionParser classes in moz2po and po2moz
	  the new class is convert.ArchiveConvertOptionParser, should be
	  able to use for OO GSI files too...  moz2po now just uses the
	  class directly, po2moz adds one method this required some changes
	  to the xpi.XpiFile class, basically it uses a few methods and
	  iterators/in operator so should be simple to implement other
	  archive classes...

2004-09-30 11:36  davidfraser

	* misc/optrecurse.py: since splitinputext and splittemplateext are
	  the same in the baseclass, and useful, made splitext that does
	  that, and call it from them (splitinputext is overridden
	  sometimes for some reason)

2004-09-30 11:30  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added __iter__, __contains__, openinputfile,
	  openoutputfile methods used by convert  - that means it doesn't
	  have to know much about XpiFiles if no region is found, try and
	  get it automatically from the locale name only add dirmap entries
	  for valid locale and region took out unused code for renaming
	  (done in clone now)

2004-09-30 09:17  davidfraser

	* storage/oo.py: modified to produce lots of small files rather
	  than one per module...

2004-09-30 09:07  davidfraser

	* storage/oo.py: renamed "module" variables to "subfile" in
	  oomultifile added openfile method that uses wStringIO to create a
	  pseudo-file for a subfile

2004-09-29 17:57  davidfraser

	* convert/oo2po: added GSIConvertOptionParser, analogous to
	  XpiConvertOptionParser (and based on it) This allows treating a
	  GSI file as multiple files, using oo.oomultifile similar support
	  needed for the reverse process...

2004-09-29 17:20  davidfraser

	* storage/oo.py: added oomultifile class that can be used to treat
	  smaller sections of a file as individual oofiles

2004-09-29 16:32  davidfraser

	* convert/oo2po: added support for passing language parameters on
	  command line, TODO for making it work properly :-)

2004-09-28 14:12  davidfraser

	* convert/po2moz: added option to change locale, which restructures
	  directories etc inside xpi jars using new xpi.clone parameters
	  this is required for the round-trip xpi -> po -> xpi to work,
	  which is now complete extended warning when files not found in
	  structure

2004-09-28 14:10  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: various changes needed to handle directory
	  structures when changing language names (removed TODOs) split
	  initdirmap into findlangreg and setlangreg move files directly in
	  xpi (not in a sub-jar) into a "package" directory added method
	  restructurejar which moves things from one lang-region to another
	  modified clone to reconstruct jars using restructurejar keep
	  locale and region as members

2004-09-28 12:21  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: updated to handle languages list better

2004-09-28 12:10  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: only print out the name when listing files...

2004-09-28 12:08  davidfraser

	* storage/html.py: added span as a text-marking tag

2004-09-28 12:06  davidfraser

	* __version__.py: version 0.8 beta 3

2004-08-31 17:48  davidfraser

	* convert/po2prop.py: added a little hook that will allow setting
	  strings to empty values by setting the msgstr to "   " (three
	  spaces)

2004-08-31 17:07  davidfraser

	* convert/dtd2po.py: fixed a bug where the logic for mixed entities
	  failed for merging dtds (basically the mixed entity was marked as
	  already merged when the original version was converted, so the
	  translation was ignored) this is fixed by using "mixbuckets" to
	  mark the alreadymerged value differently for orig and translation

2004-08-31 15:23  davidfraser

	* convert/: po2nb, nb2po: added fixes to handle end of lines sanely
	  only replace one instance of each string in the result when
	  converting back

2004-08-27 13:46  davidfraser

	* convert/po2html: only do a replace if the translation is
	  non-empty

	  name because this gives us the tab indentation we want

2004-08-18 12:06  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: added code to localize module text (name,
	  description)

2004-08-18 11:59  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: added code to insert HelpText Text(nn)
	  entries for each language - so installation Help is now localized
	  use one suffix variable per index instead of recalculating it
	  everywhere we can :-) to support inserting fields into sections,
	  added end of variables to tokennums index added methods to
	  renamefield, getfieldtokenrange, insertforeignvalue (just puts

	  for posix installers initialize members in constructor rather

2004-08-17 09:07  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: added code to add desktop / menu items with
	  icons for kde and gnome (and gnome2) this required entries to

	  current directory

2004-08-16 13:35  davidfraser

	  directory, otherwise manual selection happens anyway...

2004-08-12 11:24  davidfraser

	* tools/ooswitchlang: added lots of error handling and intelligence
	  so user gets reasonable messages if language cannot be found /
	  set if registered version directory does not exist, ignore it
	  (with a verbose log message) rather than showing message factored
	  out finding directory in version names into separate function

	* tools/ooswitchlang: forget the xmlwrapper stuff :-) added
	  TODOs...

2004-08-05 18:38  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: some files don't have a PackedName (they are
	  usually just being deleted so it doesn't matter, just leave
	  it...)

2004-08-05 17:35  davidfraser

	* convert/po2txt: added basic text wrapping

2004-08-05 17:24  davidfraser

	  po.getunquotedstr don't include escapes for text files...

2004-08-05 16:41  davidfraser

	  produce bad target files...)

2004-08-05 16:35  davidfraser

	* convert/: po2txt, txt2po: created simple po2txt

2004-08-05 12:33  davidfraser

	* tools/ooswitchlang: try import xmlwrapper from the current
	  directory if import fails...

2004-08-05 12:11  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: add -j option to zip so it doesn't include
	  the pathname added option --switchlang rather than including
	  ooswitchlang.exe if it is there

2004-08-05 11:33  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: added offset param to makepackedname in case
	  more than one is needed removed direntry parameter for
	  addmanualfile as it can be deduced from baseentry zip generates
	  .zip files so rename them...

2004-08-05 11:22  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: added self.manualfiles so any files added
	  manually are automatically zipped into the right destination
	  (currently using cmdline) added call to addfiletomodule so files
	  added manually are also listed in the modulename to be installed
	  added function makepackedname for when we need a new packedname
	  added default value option to getfieldvalue, rather than getting
	  errors added call to add ooswitchlang.exe to setup if it exists

2004-08-05 10:56  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: use isocodes for directory names rather than
	  using HostName (which could be full lang name) this means all the
	  f* files have now got shorter names

2004-08-05 10:49  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: refactored addfiletomodule to use a dummy
	  setup file rather than searching for commas...  this means we
	  don't have to leave out some files because we couldn't find the
	  commas also we don't require the index (which will make it easier
	  to add manual files)

2004-08-05 10:13  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: factored out addfiletomodule from
	  addforeignfile rename aftersection parameter of addmanualfile to
	  baseentry

2004-08-05 09:59  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: added addmanualfile method (adds a new
	  section describing a file off disk)	- to be used for adding gui
	  switchlang executable split off parsing code into base class
	  SetupParser this allows us to create a little SetupParser to
	  describe manual additions corrected dir arguments (one-off error
	  from sys.argv->optparser change)

2004-08-05 09:09  davidfraser

	* tools/ooswitchlang: changed setlanguage to take admin and force
	  as parameters setlanguage now displays errors and offers to force

	  as arguments copy other needed files (non-f*, non-setup.in[sf])

2004-08-04 12:08  davidfraser

	* tools/ooswitchlang: added browse button for selecting install dir
	  tried to improve sizing...

	  "(other)" for manually chosen directory...

2004-08-04 10:21  davidfraser

	* tools/oosetupmerge: try import on sparse and import directly if
	  not in translate.misc - to allow standalone oosetupmerge also add
	  basic commandline help...

2004-08-02 22:02  dwaynebailey

	  at end of file set entity to None initially, detect this with
	  isnull added comments to dtdelement class

2004-05-21 11:24  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: refactored po/pot selection algorithm added a
	  helper function "potifyformat" to deal with both .po and .xxx.po
	  (for mozilla) instead of using self.inputformats,
	  self.outputoptions, added functions filterinputformats and

	  required the results are stored in options.inputformats,
	  options.outputoptions which are then used to determine names
	  instead of self.inputformats, self.outputoptions also changed
	  getformathelp so it doesn't actually modify the format
	  dictionaries...

2004-05-20 20:22  dwaynebailey

	* convert/dtd2po.py: For msgid's that are blank a correct KDE style

2004-05-11 11:59  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added spacing between functions

2004-05-10 18:57  davidfraser

	* convert/po2moz: if you don't close the outputxpi you never get
	  the output...  this now actually produces an xpi with
	  translations the paths still need to be fixed up though...

2004-05-10 18:50  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, po2moz: tried to add more intelligence to

	  added ability to po2moz, moz2po to handle non-dtd, non-properties
	  files by copying them added ability to po2moz to handle xpi files
	  for templates   - po2moz now has a MozConvertOptionParser like
	  moz2po does, but it does some different stuff renamed methods
	  recursefiles to recurseinputfiles, etc in convert made convert
	  methods return lists instead of yielding generators added
	  copyinput, copytemplate methods to convert that can be used to
	  copy files

2004-05-10 17:34  davidfraser

	  formats in convert this allows more sanity and flexibility
	  basically formats expects a dictionary with keys either as
	  inputformats or (inputformat, templateformat) tuples and values
	  as tuples of (outputformat, convertmethod) this obliviates the
	  need of ConvertOptionParseExt

	  planning to use them for input

2004-05-04 15:26  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: make sure commonprefix doesn't swallow up a whole
	  file changed default extractdir to prevent errors...

2004-05-04 15:14  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added funky code to prevent funky error (if close
	  is called from __del__ it can't see the class or anything except
	  for self) all explained nicely in comments

2004-05-04 14:03  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: create directories if required in extraction

	* tools/pomerge: use new simpler parser.runconversion() to run the
	  operation

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: tried to improve intelligence of
	  recursion detection (recurse iff the input is a directory) allow

	* storage/xpi.py: added actual xpi filename into name of
	  inputstream

2004-04-15 17:29  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: added code to convert to handle
	  temporary output files using StringIO now moz2po.convertfile is
	  not neccessary...

2004-04-15 17:14  davidfraser

	* convert/: moz2po, convert.py: changed recursefiles to just yield
	  list of inputpaths instead of output, templates, ext etc moved
	  generation of output names, template names, etc to
	  recurseconversion added methods openinputfile, openoutputfile,
	  opentemplatefile to open the files...  changed getconvertmethod
	  to take inputpath, outputpath instead of extensions improved
	  logic of gettemplatename (detect if not using templates here, not
	  outside) made moz2po simpler by overriding openinputfile also
	  don't need to checksubdir for every subdir in moz2po, just let
	  convert handle it

2004-04-15 16:46  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added clever trickery so streams can have names
	  like normal files (so for example a converted po file will
	  contain the 'name' of the .dtd file from inside the xpi)

2004-04-15 16:22  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: added test for moz2po from xpi

2004-04-15 16:20  davidfraser

	* convert/: convert.py, moz2po: added methods
	  getfullinput/output/templatepath so they can be overridden in
	  derived classes (and overrode getinputpath in moz2po for xpi
	  files) this makes recurseconversion much simpler, so it doesn't
	  need to be overridden in moz2po improved directory creation
	  scheme (create a directory if we're going to create a file that
	  needs it)

2004-04-15 10:13  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: fixed bug with giving reduce an initial value -
	  limits the result thus commonprefix wasn't working...

2004-04-15 09:32  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: made non-xpi recursion return (otherwise it does
	  the standard thing, then tries the xpi thing too)

2004-04-15 09:15  davidfraser

	* convert/Makefile: added help to Makefile

2004-04-10 09:47  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: gave initial value to reduce to prevent error on
	  empty list in commonprefix

2004-04-08 15:36  davidfraser

	* convert/moz2po: added initial code to handle reading files
	  straight out of an xpi

2004-04-08 15:32  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: initprogressbar needs to return allfiles as
	  sometimes it converts it from a generator to a list...

2004-04-08 15:04  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added openinputstream method for getting a
	  file-like input stream from a file (inside the xpi or an inner
	  jar) added includedirs parameter to iterextractnames

2004-04-08 14:32  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added functions jartoospath and ostojarpath that
	  handle finding files inside jars

2004-04-08 13:56  davidfraser

	* convert/convert.py: refactored recurseconversion - was too
	  complex and difficult to override added methods initprogressbar
	  and convertfile

2004-04-08 11:12  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: modified _commonprefix to handle strings as well
	  as lists use it to simplify jarprefixes (strip leading
	  languagename-)

2004-04-08 11:04  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: a lot of refactoring extracted _commonprefix
	  method added a XpiFile constructor that reads out the important
	  information cache jarfiles in self.jarfiles so they aren't
	  extracted repeatedly added stripcommonprefix, findjarprefixes
	  methods added ziptoospath, ostozippath methods this all
	  simplifies iterextractnames a lot

2004-04-08 10:12  davidfraser

	* storage/xpi.py: added xpi module

2004-04-06 13:53  davidfraser
