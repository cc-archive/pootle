converters should work as follows:

name: in2out
  where in is the input format, out is the output format

syntax:
  in2out [[-i|--input-file] inputfile] [[-o|--output-file] outputfile] [[-t|--template] templatefile]
     inputfile - is in the input file format
     outputfile - is in the output file format
     templatefile - is a template in the output format.  The translations found im the imput file will be merged 
       with the template file to create a file in the output format.

usage:
  in2out -i translate.po -o translate.dtd -t original.dtd
  in2out < translate.po > translate.dtd
  in2out < translate.po > translate.dtd --template original.dtd

notes:
  Using a template file is important when the input format might not contain all the data found in the template file.  If you performed a raw conversion the output file might not contain all required data.  With a template file the conversion will be performed using substitution thus preserving various parts of the templae file that were not present in the input file.
