--nofuzzies option
  use original rather than fuzzies when converting back from po files

--update option
  make recursive methods only run if input is newer than output
--force option
  only overwrite files if this is given (work out which tools its applicable to)

detect whether producing a .po or a .pot (make -P / --pot unneccessary)

moz2po
  make strings fuzzy if original == translation

headers
  charset=UTF-8

csv2po
  * change order of columns: original, translation, other stuff
  * It does not currently reflow text to create a newline around literal \n
  making it difficult to check files

oo2po / po2oo
  fix problem with OOO_VENDOR and \" quoting in offmgr.po (see help - about)
  fix \n double escaping
  make oo output the same as in input file...
