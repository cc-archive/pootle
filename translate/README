Translate Toolkit
-----------------

The Translate Toolkit is a set of software and documentation designed to help
make the lives of localizers both more productive and less frustrating.  
The Toolkit is part of the translate.sourceforge.net project, 
hosted at http://translate.sourceforge.net/

The software includes programs to covert localisation formats to the common PO
format and programs to check and manage PO files.  The documentation includes
guides on using the tools, running a localization project and how to localize
various projects from OpenOffice.org to Mozilla.

At its core the software contains a set of classes for handling various 
localisation storage formats: DTD, properties, OpenOffice.org GSI/SDF,
CSV and of course PO.  And scripts to convert between these formats.

Also part of the Toolkit are Python programs to create wordcounts, merge
translations and perform various checks on PO files.

The vision of the Translate Project is to be a meta project for localizers
built on the premise that your language deserves to be a project on its own
right not a poor cousine of the main project.

Most projects are inatentive to the needs and difficulties experienced by
localizers. to that end the aim is to work towards creating tools and
documention that allows localizers to focus on what they do best: translating
software.

System Requirements
