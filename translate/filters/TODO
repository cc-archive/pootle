use unicode strings throughout the pofilter program ...
allow the user to mark strings fuzzy and write back into the input file
provide options to handle true/false
  return all that don't have empty translations
handle KDE and Gettext plural forms
allow groups of checks: eg --test-group=critical to allow focus on certain
  types of tests. -l should show these groupings
Allow test to be disabled by default eg spelling, unless you specificly invoke
  it.  This allows certain language specific test to be always off.  Might work
  well in conjunction with test-groups and a default test-group.

bugs
  startcaps - read the locale data to determine what letters are considered
    capitals. msgid should be treated as English caps.
  startcaps - can't cope with sentence such as in Afrikaans taht start with 'n
    [CAPS].  Perhaps some prefilter to remove the 'n if the language is AF?
    Would need to be able to detect the language.

other checks
  stop words - 
	same: eg. OpenOffice or IMAP should not be translated.
	different: Color, Maximize should be translated
  plural checks - check plural forms against the Gettext plural header
    fallback to list of valid plurals for KDE.
  Supper basic machine translation - en_GB changes color -> colour
  emails/URLs - checks emails and URLs to make sure they have not been altered
  punc count - .,: all add up.  Simple way to see if all sentences where
	translated.
  detect french style end punc ie [space][!?]
  spell checker: spell check the msgstr based on the locale and aspell/myspell
    installed on the system.  Would it work to define the language code
    properly in the PO header so that Pootle could then also check spelling of
    various files.  Might need to extend the #_ error comment to highlight what
    words had errors.
