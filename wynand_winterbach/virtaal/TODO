Known Issues
------------

There are artefacts in the drawing of the editor when at the bottom of a document. 
-> Possibly solve this by moving the editor widget with custom code
-> Anyone want to write a custom widget? :)
-> Use a different order of activating the various widgets
-> Bypass the editing functionality of the treeview widget and replace it with custom
   editing functionality. You might want to consider using the facilities provided to
   find the x,y position of a cell in the treeview.
   
"Flickering" artefacts when the editor is drawn. This comes about because the the
treeview draws a block of a different colour before it draws the editor widget. If
the user quickly moves through the cells, this creates the illusion of flickering.
