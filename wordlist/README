This directory provides the follwoing scripts

* get-words - extract words from PO, PDF, MO, HTML and Lynx DAT files
* new-words - eliminate existing words from a wordlist
* sort-length - provide a length sorted wordlist


get-words
---------
Get words will extract words from HTML pages, Gettext PO and MO files, PDF files and
Lynx -traversal -crawl lnk*.dat files.  We should expand it to allow us to retreive 
words from Microsoft Office documents.

Various transforms are performed on the input file to ensure that we get the words but
none of the rubbish.

Requirements:
 - pdftotext (from xpdf) - to convert PDF files to text
 - msgunfmt (from gettext) - to convert MO files to PO format for text extraction
 - msgexec (from gettext) - to extract text from Gettext PO files
 - lynx - to extract text from HTML files

new-words
---------
Designed to highlight new words found by get-words.  The list of new words is filtered 
against any number of existing word lists to highlight any new words.  The existing lists
could include:
 - The language wordlist - to eliminate words already included
 - Other language wordlist - including the English wordlist would eliminate words 
                             that might not have been translated
 - Jargon files - to eliminate Jargon eg computer Jargon or KDE jargon
 - Proper name lists - eliminate Place and people names
 - Reject list - words that have already been reviewed and rejected to save re-reviewing
 - English domain wordlist - the untranslated words from a software domain to eliminate
                             untranslated entries found in the translated domain

Usage:
	./new-words new existing-wordlist english-wordlist kde-jargon rejects etc etc
	as many other lists as required may be added

sort-length
-----------
This will produce a sort of a wordlist based on the length of the words.  This may prove useful when
searching for occurances of new words using the web.

The language wordlist would first be filtered using new-words with all the reject lists being 
all other language lists available.  This would produce a list of words unique to your language.
Sorting them against length eliminates potential false postives, although very long words
may be unique to the wordlist and not be present on the web.

This list would then be used to query search engines.  The returned pages would then be used as 
potential starting points for finding new words.  

It would probably make sense to evaluate the page to determine if it indeed is in the language under
investigation.  This could be done by checking the statistical frequency of dictionary words within 
the page, although this would then depend on a good wordlist for the language.
