These are the tasks to merge toolkit-C-po branch into trunk:

ISSUES
- ctypes cdll.LoadLibrary cannot find libraries in /usr/local/lib

- oo2po
++ Commit all oo2po changes
++ Merge test_oo2po into trunk
-- Run test across a release of oo2po with CPO and without and explain any difference.
--- Use plain comparison
--- Run through msgcat to get same pypo and cpo output
--- Run test with clean 1.0.1 vs trunk (some changes with #. might confuse things)

- xliff2po
++ Commit all xx2po changes
++ Merge test_xx2po into trunk
-- Run test across a release of oo2po with CPO and without and explain any difference.
--- Use plain comparison
--- Run through msgcat to get same pypo and cpo output
--- Run test with clean 1.0.1 vs trunk (some changes with #. might confuse things)

- pot2po
++ Commit all xx2po changes
++ Merge test_xx2po into trunk (mostly taking the current tests from quilt
++ Hacked a work around #: tests (pypo and cpo have different behaviour)
-- Blank comment test fails # -> #[space] in cpo
-- Obsoleting (libgettexpo behaviour does not follow msgmerge - bug reported to gettext)

- dtd2po
++ Commit all po2dtd and dtd2po changes
++ Merge test_xx2po into trunk (added some additional tests)
-- Need to test in conjunction with a Mozilla migration

- po2txt (don't seem to have needed any txt2po commits)
++ Commit all po2txt change
-- Double check that all txt2po have been commited (if there where any)

- csv2po 
++ Commit all csv2po change
++ Commit all po2csv change

- prop2po
++ Commit all prop2po change
-- Double check po2prop
++ Commit all uncommited branch test_* fixes

+ ts2po

- cpo
-- introduce check to ensure that our space removal hack only happens in older versions on libgettextpo
-- Check that we free memory properly.  Run a simulated run.
-- Profile - hey what the heck lets try at least win some ground
--- profile counting (parsing)
--- profile oo2po (serlialisation)
--- profile pofilter (both and message manipulation)
-- fix tmp file hack
+++ Report bug to Gettext to allow string parsing (done, might happen but they did question why we need strings anyway?)
-- Move an shared pypo tests in test_po reenable any if needed
-- Examine again for shared code (hint anything without gpo.* is likely shareable)
-- Handle failures more gracefully i.e. flesh out the callbacks and raise exceptions or something

- pypo
-- Make everything output a header no header becomes an option
--- pogrep
--- poconflicts
--- pofilter
--- check that we merge headers correctly
---- options in pomerge to not merge the header
-- Determine how to do current unit level test if we have a header
-- Make disaccotiated comments behave like in cpo eg #.\n\n#. one idea is to add an emoty #. line or #. ---------

- po
-- Find any other common tests and move to test_po
-- Switch default to CPO

- moz2po
- pomerge
- pogrep
- pocount
- poconflicts
- podebug
- etc, etc
