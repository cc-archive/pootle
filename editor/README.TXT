How it works
------------
The idea is to have it worked with po file and can also handle most information in
XLIFF file.

Requirements/Installation
-------------------------

WordForge Translation Editor requires the Translate Toolkit package from 
http://translate.sourceforge.net as it uses most of the other modules.

The Translate Toolkit requires Python 2.2 or higher.It must 
be installed properly i.e. it needs to be accessible in your Python Path. This
will normally be accomplished by installing from source:

	python setup.py install	

Running
-------
For Linux User:
    
    python MainEditor.py
    
For Windows User:
    Not available yet.
    
Bug Reporting/Feature requests
------------------------------
You can always report bugs or feature requests on the mailing list but because of the increase
in users and the fact that bug reports do go missing it is probably best to place your
bug report in Bugzilla: http://bugs.wordforge.org/

If you have a traceback or a patch then please include it.  Also please be quite specific
about how the bug occured and what you expected to happen.

If this is a feature request then try to be specific about how you think this feature should 
work.
