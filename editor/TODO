FIXME:

DONE:

- after opening of a file the first TU should be selected---------done
- first and previous are disabled after loading a file even if I click in the overview 
    to another entry-------done
- the actions for navigation are wrong placed in the edit menu and you should create also 
    a toolbar for them-----------done
- set a minimum size for source and target so that the user can not make them disappear--------done
- remove the word index from the header in overview, it not really carry meaning and it
    looks ugly when I make the column small-------done
- Open in New Window: open dialog comes first, then the selected file loaded in the new window later.---------done
- Status bar should be permanently displayed, even when we click on menu.----------done
- A keyboard shortcut is meant for actions the user would want to use 
frequently. You have shortcuts for "About" and "About QT". These actions are 
rarely used and do not deserve a shortcut. Please remove the shortcuts, they 
are a precious resource. Do not waste them for this.
--------done

- after I start the editor the title is "Main Window"--------done

- in the menu the entry "Find Again" should be better named "Find Next". And 
could we have a "Find Previous" as well? --------done

- I could not find a way to enable/disable the toolbars?
not only toolbars, but also all three views come by default.
---------done

- in the Go menu you use "F3" and "shift + F3" for next and previous. I wonder 
if it would be better to use "ctrl + alt + PageUp" and "ctrl + alt + 
PageDown" instead? The reason is the keys are close to the other two 
shortcuts and share the same modifier. 
----------
F3: Find Next
Shift+F3: Find Previous
Ctrl+PgUp: First
Ctrl+PgDown: Last
PgUp: Next
PgDown: Previous
-----------done

- In the view menu you use "ToolView" which is rather technical. Can you find 
a better name? Maybe just "Views" or if you want to keep "tool" maybe "Tool 
Views"; see the plural here.-----------done

- Move View|Filter up because it is more important.--------done
- Ctrl + A : select all, not save As-----------------done
- I really think that this is not yet version 1.0 as you claim in the about 
dialog. This is far away from what we planned to implement, so better choose 
a number below 1.0. Actually I would go with 0.1  ;-) 
-------------ok

- Open dialog crash whenever user choose file type.----done

NOt YET:
- decrease the margins in the toolviews, you do not need so much space around the widgets    

- you need a way to revert to the previous content of target after you hit F2
    (action with ESC key bound to it?) 
    Use undo instead of F2

- Cannot markFuzzy, as long as the source is translated.

- Whenever txtTarget is emptied, the untranslated num is decreased immediately with leaving txtTarget.

- Similarly, once you copy from source2Target, the untranslated num is increased immediately with leaving txtTarget.

-for PO file,on top contains translator information and file header, so it should not be displayed in overview, Detail, or Comment.

- Edit tab order

-undo/redo should follow kbabel style: track one char by one char regardless object.

- Comment your code! It is not acceptable the way how it is right now! I 
repeat myself here: you have to come to the point where coding and commenting 
is one. Do not think you will add comments later, you won't do it and other 
people want to read the code meanwhile too!

- In find.py you should use a technic called lazy init. You create here a GUI 
that is hidden initially. Instead of creating the GUI in the constructor you 
should only create the action and on the first time the action is triggered 
you would create the GUI. The benefit is that the construction of the class 
if faster which makes the application start up quicker. 

- Detect Save/Cancel button
=======

- Move the mainwindow class into a file in modules and make the filename of the main script only lowercase.
