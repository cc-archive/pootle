FIXME:

- after opening of a file the first TU should be selected---------done
- you need a way to revert to the previous content of target after you hit F2
    (action with ESC key bound to it?) 
- first and previous are disabled after loading a file even if I click in the overview 
    to another entry
- the actions for navigation are wrong placed in the edit menu and you should create also 
    a toolbar for them-----------done
- decrease the margins in the toolviews, you do not need so much space around the widgets    
- set a minimum size for source and target so that the user can not make them disappear--------done
- remove the word index from the header in overview, it not really carry meaning and it
    looks ugly when I make the column small
- Open in New Window: open dialog comes first, then the selected file loaded in the new window later.---------done
- Status bar should be permanently displayed, even when we click on menu.----------done
- Cannot markFuzzy, as long as the source is translated.
- Whenever txtTarget is emptied, the untranslated num is decreased immediately with leaving txtTarget.
- Similarly, once you copy from source2Target, the untranslated num is increased immediately with leaving txtTarget.
-Ctrl+Alt+home/Ctrl+Alt+end: are not working with txtTarget
