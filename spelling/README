spelld - Spelling Server
========================

Server
------

  ./spelld.py

Will start a server on port 8008 serving spell checker results for the following
spellcheckers:

  * Remote Google (it acts as a proxy).  Default for languages served by Google.
  * Local Enchant spellers
  * Locale Microsoft Spellers over OLE (Note: not a CSAPI checker).  Currently not
    working since we've just ported the code.

--help for other options.

Client
------

The client is mostly for testing checker queries and results.  It will print the
query XML query sent and the XML result received.

  ./spellclient -t "Txt to spel" -l en

Is the simplest check this will be by default against Google.

  ./spellclient -t "Txt to spel" -l en -s http://localhost:8008/

Will still check against Google but going through your local spelld.  This 
will know also use a server based group PWL (ie not a real PWL but one for
all users of the server).

Change the language, -l to a language not server by Google but for which you have 
an Enchant spell checker eg af (Afrikaans) and the server will use Enchant and
return the same result XML but from spelld, not Google.
