	* allow status of input PO to override destination ie if input is not fuzzy
    and destination is fuzzy that is you corrected it then make merged message
    not fuzzy
	- Don't merge header.  If there is a header is should be merged as indicates 
      last translators info but should be allowed to specify that it not get
      merged.
    - msgblock headers ie #: should remain unchanged.  There seems to be a bug
      that adds entries on one line when the output templates have them on
	  seperate lines.
    - Allow merge without a template and thus us the output as a template.  Or
      at least don't complain when you don't find the templates.

New tools
	Some ideas for tools that would be helpfull
	podiff - normal diff show too much spurious data.  We need something that
		can ignore the location and just shaw the changes in text.  So you
		could receive an updated PO file but the diff would not show spurious
		changes in the header and could match strings in different location.
		The output could then be smething like diff -u
	glossary_creator - take input text or PO file and extract a) the most
		frequent words and b) the most frequent word pairs.  So things like
		"Proxy Server" are extracted. The idea being that you can create a
		glossary for a single PO file or for the whole project like KDE.
		Translators get to define important words before beginning to translate

pocount
	- Only provide total if more than one file processed
	- Count blank "   " messages seperately - currently does not count them but
	  then figure is different to msgfmt --statistics.
	- Optionally count items marked for review
	- Provide Grand Total per item ie fuzzy+translated+untranslated
	- Fix po class so that it handles KDE style plurals there not in pocount
