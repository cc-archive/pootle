The following are tasks that need to happen in cPo.

libgettextpo
------------
* The wrapper assumes PO files come from files.  It would be nice if 
  it could accept PO strings.  This would remove our need to write 
  strings to files before parsing

Wrapper
-------
* Solve the problem with xerror handler
* Build using the .so for libgettextpo based on gettext-devel file 
  instead of using the checked out sources
* Integrate the building i.e. integrates running swig and compiling 
  the wrapper into the toolkit build system ./setup.py

cPo
---
* Reenable currently disabled tests and fix any issues

Users
-----
* Convert user of po.py to cpo.py and solve problems as they occur
