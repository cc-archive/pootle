Write down use cases:
a) developer runs Pootle for software translation
b) coordinator runs Pootle for project translation
c) commit small fixes
d) translation repository
...

Small tasks:
+ Separate .po header
+ fix makestore() and clonestore() mess.
- Abstract fuzzy status.
- Deal with obsolete .po entries (#~)
- Implement Module.add(x, copy_template=True)
+ Add itervalues() to IMapping.
- Fix containment mess (make constructor and adding separate)?
- Flesh out ITranslationUnit
- Clean up ILanguageInfo interface
- Implement TranslationUnit indices properly
- Transactions in RDB backend.

Transitions:
- store.template == store[None]?
+ Make Database.root the root folder rather than inherit.
+ Add annotations to objects.
- Put unit comments into container.
- Get rid of suggestions.
- Store annotations in comments for read/write_po.

Important:
+ preliminary .po parser
+ preliminary readonly layer over Pootle's storage
+ demo XML-RPC server
+ substring search in API
- thorough definition of TranslationUnit + parser
+ read/write layer over Pootle's storage
- Pootle's metadata (special files) support in storage layer
- complete .po parser
- .po serializer
+ ask around about DDTP access
+ ask around about debconf template access
- Think about store.save() and store.load()

Long term:
+ consider use of SQLObject or SQLAlchemy for RDB storage
- Write some annotation wrappers: ownership, review, etc.
- Implement a merger using external 'msgmerge'.
- Write a guide.
- Wrap pootle's internal pounit.merge.
- Import language info from Pootle config.
- Go through TODOs and XXXes.
- Language information DB storage
- Caching for storage.standard.

Debian-specific:
+ Hook up DDTP
- Add a script to import debconf translations

Misc:
- Write a small server for quick typo fix webapp.
- Produce direct hyperlinks to unit context in the source code by storing
  a link to ViewVC.
- Maybe for some objects IMapping.keys() should be sorted?

Other subsystems to consider:
- Versioning / changesets (related with review)
+ Merging mechanism
+ Language information DB (language name, plural equations, etc.)
- Translation compendium
| Security model (important!)
| Translation review (important!)
| Pootle checkers
| Pootle-like "goals"
